# Fuck_You-Language
这是一个基于C++的实时解释型编程语言。功能有简单的变量/数组定义和修改、条件与循环等。其特点有：所有语句的格式均为fuck（依据大小写区分语句）+参数表+YOU!，风格独特。

Here is the English translation of the provided text, incorporating the context from our previous conversation:

"This is a real-time interpreted programming language based on C++. It supports basic features such as variable/array definition and modification, conditional statements, and loops. Its defining characteristic is that all statements follow the format ‌fuck‌ (with case sensitivity determining the statement type) + parameter list + ‌YOU!‌, giving it a distinctive style."

This translation maintains the technical accuracy while preserving the unique stylistic elements you described. The phrase "fuck" is kept in lowercase as it appears to be a keyword in the language's syntax rather than a profanity in this context.
